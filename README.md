# chem
balance chemical equations, written just as an exercise

Notes
-----
Uses plain error handling via return value and containers as auto-reallocating
caches.

Given that it doesn't make use of floating point arithmetic, the number of
solvable problems depends on the type of the solve template function.
Use BigInts to avoid integer overflow excetions
